            Without getting too technical, Web 3.0 (also referred to as Web3 or the “Semantic Web”) is a new,
            decentralized version of the Internet. It utilizes machine learning, artificial intelligence, and semantic
            search tools to deliver a more user-friendly and faster experience.

            Unlike the current setup (where data is typically owned by a handful of huge corporations), Web 3.0 is built
            on the underlying layers of blockchain technology and “edge computing,” which will see the data being mainly
            owned and managed by internet users. This latest iteration is also set to enable more direct and live
            interaction with websites and internet connected smart machines (IoT).
