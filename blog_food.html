            <b>           Back in 2008, when this blog was very young, I discovered how much I loved the “stick to your ribs” satisfaction that a bowl of oatmeal gave me for breakfast. I always make my oats with two key ingredients: milk (for protein) and banana (for natural sweetness). And I always go crazy with toppings!

            YES!! Oats are a whole grain and a great source of complex carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants. The soluble fiber from oatmeal, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may help reduce the risk of heart disease. Beta-glucans are one form of that soluble fiber that helps lower blood cholesterol. <a href="/">Here are more benefits of eating oats.</a>

            Ingredients </h2>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup old fashioned oats
            </li>
            <li>1/3 cup milk of your choice</li>
            <li>2/3 cup water I like my oats a bit liquidy - cut back to 1/2 a cup if you don't
            </li>
            <li>1/2 banana very thinly sliced
            </li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp chia seeds
            </li>
            <li>Pinch of kosher salt
            </li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract stirred in at end
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ul>

<li>Start by combining rolled oats, water, and milk in a saucepan over medium heat:</li>
                <li>Slice a banana into VERY thin pieces, leaving just a few bigger chunks.</li>
                <li>Walk away for a few minutes while the oatmeal heats.
                </li>
                <li>Once it begins to steam or bubble, stir vigorously at times to “whip” the banana into the oats. The oats will take about 5 minutes on medium heat from start to finish to fully absorb the liquid. They’re done when they reach your desired consistency!
                </li>
                <li>Stir in vanilla (and often pumpkin or cottage cheese) and pour into your bowl.
                </li>
                <li>Add any toppings you like, such as almond or peanut butter dollops, nuts, granola, coconut, crumbled granola bars, or trail mix – with dark chocolate chips! Or check out all the combos listed below.
